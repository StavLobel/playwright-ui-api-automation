This test verifies that the distance between KIX (Kansai International Airport)
and NRT (Narita International Airport) is greater than 400 kilometers.

Steps:
1. Send POST request to /api/airports/distance
2. Include request body with KIX and NRT airport codes
3. Verify HTTP response status is 200
4. Parse the JSON response
5. Extract the distance value in kilometers
6. Verify distance is greater than 400 km
7. Validate distance is reasonable (< 2000 km for Japan domestic)

Expected Result:
- HTTP status code is 200 (OK)
- Response contains distance calculation data
- Distance between KIX and NRT is > 400 kilometers
- Response includes distance in multiple units (km, miles, nautical miles)

This test verifies that the AirportGap API correctly returns
exactly 30 airports in the response.

Steps:
1. Send GET request to /api/airports endpoint
2. Parse the response JSON
3. Count the number of airports in the data array
4. Verify the count equals exactly 30

Expected Result:
- API responds with 200 status code
- Response contains exactly 30 airports
- Each airport has required fields (id, type, attributes)

This test verifies that specific airports (Akureyri, St. Anthony, CFB Bagotville)
are present in the AirportGap API response.

Steps:
1. Send GET request to /api/airports
2. Verify HTTP response status is 200
3. Parse the JSON response and extract airport data
4. Create a list of all airport names from the response
5. Verify ""Akureyri"" airport is present in the list
6. Verify ""St. Anthony"" airport is present in the list
7. Verify ""CFB Bagotville"" airport is present in the list

Expected Result:
- All three specified airports are found in the response
- Airport names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Each airport has complete attribute information
