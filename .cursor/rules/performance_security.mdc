# Performance
- Do not use sleep(); prefer explicit waits with timeouts and page.wait_for_load_state().
- Cache frequently used locators.
- Run tests in parallel when safe.
- Clean up resources such as browser contexts, API sessions, and temp files via fixtures.

# Security
- Do not commit credentials or API keys.
- Sanitize sensitive data in logs and reports.
- Respect rate limits, set reasonable timeouts, and validate all external inputs.
