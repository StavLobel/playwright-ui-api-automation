# Environment and Configuration
- Manage settings with Pydantic classes and env prefixes such as SAUCEDEMO_, AIRPORTGAP_, BROWSER_, TEST_.
- Provide defaults and support local, CI, and staging environments.
- Never commit secrets; use environment variables.
- Configure logging in YAML with correlation IDs and component-separated handlers.
- Prefer JSON logging format for structured analysis.
