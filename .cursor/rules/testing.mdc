# Testing Practices
- Use pytest markers: @pytest.mark.ui, @pytest.mark.api, @pytest.mark.smoke.
- Group related tests in classes prefixed with Test.
- Test method names are descriptive.
- Do not hardcode test data; store under testdata/ in YAML or JSON and load via data_loader.
- Assertions include clear messages with expected vs actual values.
- UI: use Playwright expect() where possible.
- API: verify status codes, response structure, and payload content.
