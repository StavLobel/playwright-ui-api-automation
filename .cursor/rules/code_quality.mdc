# Code Quality
- Type hints are mandatory for all public functions, methods, and class attributes.
- Use typing primitives such as Optional, List, Dict, and Union.
- Google-style docstrings for all public classes and methods with description, Args, Returns, Raises, and Examples when useful.
- Inline comments to explain non-obvious design choices.
- Structured logging via LoggerAdapter with correlation IDs.
- Log start and end of each method, include timings and context.
